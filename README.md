# NDC-Topic-Modelling

## Usage
In the course of my bachelor thesis an unsupervised LDA model was developed, that is able to find the desired number of topics in multiple NDC documents. These documents are the long-term climate strategies and are published by each country. The model gives out some visualisation in form of customized wordclouds in the theme of the interpreted topic, as the topics are not assignet to a certain topic in the unsupervised model. 

## Data

A compilation of NDCs stored in one CSV file. For the data engineering the data was downloaded from the UN website and then cleaned and stored into a CSV file in an iterativ process.
